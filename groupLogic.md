### GROUP CLASSIFICATION SUMMARY

Each automatically generated group is classified into one of four strength levels — **Strongest**, **Strong**, **Medium**, or **Weak** — based on preference alignment, project compatibility, academic balance, and major diversity. The rules below describe how each level is determined.

---

#### **1. STRONGEST GROUP**
Represents the highest-quality match between students and project preferences.  
All of the following must be satisfied:
- Every member **mutually “likes”** every other member; no “avoid” preferences exist.  
- All members have **identical project preference orders** (same projects in the same sequence).  
- The associated project is ranked **within the top three preferences** of every member.  
- **Group size exactly matches** the project’s capacity.  
- The group includes **four or more distinct majors**.  
- When multiple Strongest groups exist, they are internally ranked by:  
  1. How closely they match the project’s capacity,  
  2. The number of distinct majors, and  
  3. The average CWA (higher is stronger).

---

#### **2. STRONG GROUP**
Indicates a well-matched group with minor deviations from the ideal.  
All of the following are satisfied:
- All members **mutually “like”** each other; no “avoid” preferences.  
- Members share the **same set of project preferences**, but the order may differ.  
- The associated project appears **within the top three** preferences for every member.  
- **Group size exactly equals** the project’s capacity.  
- The group contains **two to three distinct majors**.

---

#### **3. MEDIUM GROUP**
Represents a viable but less optimal combination of students.  
Any of the following conditions may apply:
- Meets all Strongest criteria **except** that the group size is **smaller than** the project’s capacity.  
- Meets Strongest or Strong criteria **except** that the project is **ranked fourth or lower** by one or more members.  
- Members have **mutual likes** but only **partially overlapping** project preferences.  
- Members all mutually like each other but have **no project preferences recorded**.  
- Members have **similar CWAs** (within ±5) and have been added to fill a project-based group.  
- Moderate diversity (typically one to three distinct majors).  
- Undersized mutual-like groups may be **filled automatically** with additional students who:
  - Have listed the same project within their preferences, and  
  - Have a **CWA within ±5 (or ±10 fallback)** of the group’s average.  
  These filler additions ensure that capacity is reached where feasible while preserving compatibility.

---

#### **4. WEAK GROUP**
Represents fallback groupings used to include remaining students with minimal compatibility.  
Any of the following conditions may apply:
- Members share only **partial mutual liking** or **no mutual liking**.  
- Members have **similar top project choices** but do not mutually like each other.  
- Members share **no common project** but have **similar CWAs** (within ±10).  
- Created as **leftover or balancing groups** to ensure every student is included.  
- Weak groups are **not automatically linked to a project** at creation; a project may be assigned later.

---

#### **5. ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION RULES**
- **Anti-preferences:** Any “avoid” relationship between two students prevents a group from being created.  
- **Over-capacity handling:** If a mutual-like clique exceeds its project’s capacity, it is **split by descending CWA** into smaller subgroups, balancing sizes as evenly as possible (e.g., 5+4 instead of 6+3).  
- **Undersized handling:** Groups smaller than a project’s capacity may be **automatically filled** with unallocated students who both prefer the same project and have similar CWAs (±5 ideal, ±10 fallback).  
- **Capacity balancing:** When forming Medium or Weak groups, the system prioritises projects with fewer existing suggested groups to ensure even distribution.  
- **Leftover handling:** Any ungrouped students are placed into small, diverse **Weak groups** (typically 4–5 members) based on similar CWAs.
